This repo is to help me track the changes in my software building process. 
This repo is to help me track the changes in my software building process. 
This software is done to support earlier work done before which involved hardware components. 
Optimizing this software to work with the hardware will not only ease the task of monitoring the predictions from my stethoscope but will also help me improve my python skills. 
Python is my language of choice because I have used it before so I'm very familiar with it syntax.
